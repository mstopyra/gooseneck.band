## Duncan Macmillan
Duncan is a student at UNC Chapel Hill. He is all things strings. You'll frequently hear him grooving at mach-jesus on banjo, ripping out tasteful, bluesy solos on guitar, and piping out some smooth vocals on home-grown lyrics. Duncan finds inspiration in artists such as the Avett Brothers, Mark Knopfler, James Taylor, and Blaze Foley. 

## Max Stopyra
Max is a student at Olin college of engineering. He is all things rhythm and bass. He is typically found plucking a riff out on bass, experimenting with sound design, holding down a groove on guitar, and if you're listening closely, you might just hear him sing a little. Max's influences include Haruomi Hosono, Paul Jackson, Elliot Smith, and Bill Withers.
